Author - Ameya Parab

About:
This case study is about conducting risk analysis of loan getting defaulted

Methodology:
- sample data set is first cleaned for unwanted columns and undefined rows

Brief analysis
- Pie chart is drawn to understand the percentage of default and purposes of loan
- Further charts are drawn to identify the risk areas
- It was observed that majority of loan number and loan amount are concentrated in the four major cities
- It was also observed that high risk categories are offered higher amount of loan compared to low risk categories
- Grade wise analysis was done and found that although loan taken for debt consolidation poses obvious high risk, loans taken for small businesses are likely to default more than any other purpose throughout all the grades. The likely hood increases in high risk grades
